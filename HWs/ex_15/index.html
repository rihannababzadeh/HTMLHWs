                        <h3>Canada to tax internet giants to protect cultural sector </h3>

                    <p><strong>Canada is mulling a plan to impose tax on internet giants such as Google, Facebook and Netflix in a bid to protect its cultural sector, which authorities say has been left behind from the benefits of the digital economy.</strong></p> 
                    <p>Simon Ross, a spokesman for Heritage Ministry of Canada, said on Wednesday that efforts were underway to update Canada's 1991 Broadcasting Act so that large internet companies would be required to operate within Canada’s regulatory frameworks.<br>

                            “The government of Canada recognizes that large internet companies are acting outside regulatory frameworks and may be a threat to our culture,” said Ross, adding that review process will start soon.</p>
